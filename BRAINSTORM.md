# The main idea

Make a playable chess game, PvP, PvAI and AIvAI.

We will use OOP.

People can make their A.I. following a Player Interface.

This can be an Web Application or an actual independent software. We don't want to use game engines because there's no big difficulties. We don't want the things easier.

## Web Application V.S. Software

They probably have their pros and cons.

### Web Application

Pros:
+ Already have a GUI on the browser to work on;
+ To play online the system probably it easier to make;
+ We have expirence on browser applications.

Cons:
- Users files for their A.I. can maybe be unsafe.

### Software

Pros:
+ idk

Cons:
- Making an GUI would be new for use.
